## Style Guidelines:

- Primary accent colour (Cyan): #00E5FF for CTAs, highlights, glow elements
- Background gradient colours: #060714 → #150B2E → #0B1020 (deep violet to near-black)
- Secondary accent colours (Magenta/Purple): #FF00D4, #C752FF, #7C4DFF for outlines, glows, badges, skill icons
- Headings use Montserrat Bold (Google Font)
- Body text uses Inter Regular (Google Font)
- UI labels/buttons use Space Grotesk Medium (Google Font)
- All desktop layouts displayed inside a 16:9 screen frame to mimic a futuristic console
- Glass panels/cards use rgba(11,16,32,0.85–0.9) with frosted edges and soft inner highlight
- Cards have 18–32px rounded corners
- Dual-tone outer glows in cyan/magenta applied to card edges
- Cards lift slightly (2–4px) on hover and glow intensifies
- Use generous negative space so neon glows are not crowded
- Micro-animations use 150–250ms ease-out timing
- Toggles and sliders show soft neon trails or bloom effects
- Parallax allowed only for hero backgrounds (minimal, slow)
- Maintain high text contrast on dark backgrounds
- Avoid placing low-opacity text on glow-heavy areas
- Provide alt text for all images
- Ensure full keyboard navigation compatibility
- Line‑based neon icons. Thin geometric outlines with cyan/magenta glow effects. Works well for navigation menus and buttons.
- Crystal / polygonal icons. Icons shaped like facets, shards, or wireframe crystals — echoing your crystalline background aesthetic.
- Circuit‑inspired glyphs. Icons with subtle circuit traces or node‑link motifs, reinforcing the “digital mesh” look.
- Minimal futuristic pictograms. Simplified shapes (triangles, hexagons, arrows) with neon rim lighting. Perfect for CTAs like “Get Started.”
- Animated micro‑icons. Small hover animations (pulse, glow, rotate) to make the interface feel alive without being overwhelming.
- Glow pulse → buttons or icons softly expand their glow on hover.
- Neon flicker → headings or accents simulate a quick neon light flicker when loaded.
- Parallax drift → background mesh or crystalline shapes move slightly as you scroll.
- Hover lift → cards or CTAs rise 4–6px with a glow shadow.
- Gradient shimmer → text or icons get a moving gradient highlight.
- Toggle morph → switches (like Data Saver Mode) slide with a glowing trail.
